<div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>HTML is a language used to create web pages and it has changed a lot since 
it was first created. In this assignment, we will learn about the different versions of HTML and 
how they evolved over time.</p>
</div>

<ol>

<div>
<h2><li>HTML Version 1.0</li></h2>
<p>HTML Version 1.0 was created in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee. It was a basic 
language that only included things like headings, paragraphs, and links. It wasn't used a lot 
because the internet was still new.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2><li>HTML Version 2.0</li></h2>
<p>HTML Version 2.0 was created in 1995 and it had new features like tables 
and forms. It also introduced the idea of cascading style sheets (CSS), which made it easier to 
change how web pages looked.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2><li>HTML Version 3.2</li></h2>
<p>HTML Version 3.2 was made in 1997 and it had even more features like 
frames, which let developers split a web page into different sections. It also had client-side image 
maps, which made it possible to click on different parts of an image.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2><li>HTML Version 4.0</li></h2>
<p>HTML Version 4.0 was created in 1997 and it had big changes like support 
for style sheets, scripting languages, and multimedia. It also had semantic markup, which let 
developers use tags that were more meaningful.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2><li>XHTML</li></h2>
<p>XHTML was created in 2000 and it was a different kind of HTML that was stricter 
and more complex. It didn't become popular because it was too hard to use.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2><li>HTML5</li></h2>
<p>HTML5 was introduced in 2014 and included significant changes such as support for 
multimedia, new structural elements, and a simpler syntax. It also introduced new APIs 
(Application Programming Interfaces) such as the Canvas API, which allowed developers to 
create dynamic graphics and animations. HTML5 is the current standard for web development 
and is widely supported by modern browsers.</p>
